## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Documentation Trunk**: `PROJECT-INDEX.md`, `PROJECT-MAP.md`, `PROJECT-MEMORY/MEMORY-LATEST.md` for centralized navigation and context
- **SSE Hardening**: Event IDs (`id:` field), retry hints (`retry: 3000`), and `Last-Event-ID` support for reliable reconnection
- **Inspector Visibility**: Gallery always visible in Actions tab (no longer conditional on element selection)
- **ARIA Compliance**: Tablist/tab/tabpanel roles added to Inspector component for accessibility
- **REVISOR Artifacts**: Round 3 test results documented (`docs/_artifacts/revisor-round3/`)

### Changed
- **E2E Selectors**: Updated `generation-comfy.spec.ts` to use `data-testid='actions-tab'` instead of role-based selector
- **PROJECT-STATUS-FULL.md**: Refreshed with current stabilization status (8/9 E2E passing, LHCI blocked)

### Fixed
- **Inspector Gallery**: Now always present in Actions tab (fixes E2E assertion failures)
- **SSE Reconnection**: Clients can now resume streams using `Last-Event-ID` header

### Known Issues
- **LHCI Blocked**: Lighthouse CI fails with `CHROME_INTERSTITIAL_ERROR` on `http://127.0.0.1:3002` (Windows localhost binding issue)
- **Idempotency**: Job creation APIs (`/api/flux`, `/api/comfy`) lack `Idempotency-Key` support (duplicate submissions possible)
- **Canvas Timing**: Playwright tests may flake if iframe content loads slowly (need explicit `frameLocator().getByText().waitFor()`)
