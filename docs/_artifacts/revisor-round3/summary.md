# REVISOR Round 3 â€” Pipeline Snapshot (2025-10-21)

**Environment**
- Branch: `main`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Run: `pnpm run revisor:all` (Next.js prod server on `http://127.0.0.1:3002`)
- Context7 refs: `/trpc/examples-next-sse-chat` for SSE guards, `/websites/nextjs_app` for App Router patterns

**E2E Results**
- âœ… 8 passed / 0 failed / 1 skipped (`sanity â€º modes toggle` uses `/design` command)
- Suites covered: Health (2), Design Mode (3), Jobs Queue (1), Generation (1), Sanity (1)
- Artifacts: `reports/playwright/html/index.html`, `reports/playwright/results.json`

**Fixes Applied This Round**
- `apps/admin/app/api/jobs/stream/route.ts`: skip partially-written job JSON before `JSON.parse`
- `apps/admin/components/builder-v0/Inspector.tsx`: gallery always visible in Actions tab
- `apps/admin/tests/e2e/generation-comfy.spec.ts`: actions tab targeted via `data-testid`

**SSE Observation**
- âœ… No more `[SSE] Poll error: Unexpected end of JSON input` during REVISOR run
- ðŸ›ˆ Worker emits heartbeat + job updates every 2s without log noise

**LHCI / Axe**
- LHCI autorun fails assertions (console errors, CRP insights, unused JS, LCP 0.72s)
- Reports were generated during the run but not checked into the repo (cleaned after verification)
- Axe not executed (pipeline aborts after LHCI)

**Next Actions**
1. Address LHCI assertions or relax thresholds in `lighthouserc.json`
2. Re-run `pnpm run revisor:all` to collect Axe data
3. Expand diagnostics page with actionable metrics (see `docs/_artifacts/diagnostics/`)
